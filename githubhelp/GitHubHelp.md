Summary: Github allows us to upload, edit, and manage code from a single online webpage.

## Instalation

To begin using Github, you need to [install GitHub Desktop on your computer](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)

Once you have Github Desktop installed, read the following images to set it up with our repository and understand how it works

## Connect to Our Repo

Follow the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop) to connect ("clone") our repo to your local machine.

You do not need to work about the "Forking the Repository" steps
